# Project Hygiene Rules

These rules prevent documentation rot and config sprawl. ALL agents must follow them.

## 1. CLI_REFERENCE.md is Auto-Generated

`docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md` is produced by `scripts/gen_cli_reference.py`. **Never edit it by hand.**

When to regenerate:
- After adding, renaming, or removing any script in `scripts/`
- After adding, renaming, or removing any config in `config/`
- After changing a script's argparse `description=`

Command:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python scripts/gen_cli_reference.py
```

## 2. Archive Completed Research

When a research round is finished (promoted to production OR abandoned):

1. Move research configs to `config/archive/`:
   ```bash
   mv config/research_<round>_*.yaml config/archive/
   ```
2. Move one-off research scripts to `scripts/archive/`:
   ```bash
   mv scripts/run_<round>_*.py scripts/archive/
   ```
3. Regenerate CLI_REFERENCE.md (see above)

Do NOT delete files — move them to `archive/` so git history remains navigable.

## 3. Doc Freshness Headers

Every living doc in `docs/` (except CLI_REFERENCE.md which is auto-generated) MUST have a header like:

```markdown
> **Last updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
```

When you modify code that a doc describes, update the `Last updated` date in that doc.

### Living docs and their triggers:

| Doc | Update when... |
|-----|---------------|
| `STRATEGY_DEV_PLAYBOOK_R2_1.md` | Methodology or lifecycle changes |
| `R3C_STRATEGY_OVERVIEW.md` | Production strategy changes |
| `R3C_SYMBOL_GOVERNANCE_SPEC.md` | Symbol governance logic changes |
| `CURSOR_WORKFLOW.md` | Agent roles or workflow changes |

## 4. Config Naming Convention

| Prefix | Meaning | Location |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `futures_<strategy>.yaml` | Strategy definition (reusable) | `config/` |
| `prod_live_*.yaml` | Frozen production config | `config/` |
| `prod_candidate_*.yaml` | Production candidate (under review) | `config/` |
| `prod_scale_rules_*.yaml` | Scale-up/down rules | `config/` |
| `risk_guard_*.yaml` | Risk guard rules | `config/` |
| `research_*.yaml` | Active research experiment | `config/` |
| (completed) | Archived | `config/archive/` |

New research configs MUST use the `research_` prefix.

## 5. No Ghost References

Before mentioning a script or config path in any doc, code comment, or agent output:
- Verify the file exists at the referenced path
- If it was archived, update the reference or remove it

## 6. Directory Structure Summary

```
config/                    ← Active configs only (~15)
config/archive/            ← Deprecated / completed research configs
scripts/                   ← Active scripts only (~30)
scripts/archive/           ← One-off research / migration scripts
docs/                      ← Living documentation (~5 files)
docs/archive/              ← Historical / superseded docs
```
